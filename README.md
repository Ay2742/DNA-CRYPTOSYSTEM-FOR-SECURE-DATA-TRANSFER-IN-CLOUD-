# DNA-CRYPTOSYSTEM-FOR-SECURE-DATA-TRANSFER-IN-CLOUD-
Due to the loss of secrecy in cloud computing, a powerful cryptosystem is required. 
The cloud may suffer from a number of vulnerabilities as a result of errors made by designers and service providers in the planning, programming, or configuration of various architectural layers, such as the infrastructure, platform, and application that can compromise the assessment of the agreed-upon quality of service. (QoS). 
Additionally, attackers choose the cloud as a popular target since it allows them to engage in offensive behaviour. Therefore, in order to project the large cloud market, a suitable and more protective cloud security is essential.
